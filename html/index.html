      <h2><abbrr title="National Hockey League">NHL</abbrr> Analytics Pipeline</h2>
      
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>This project is an end-to-end data pipeline that extracts data from the NHL API and loads it into Snowflake for analysis.</p>

        <figcaption>
          App code is packaged into a AWS Lambda function that is triggeed by AWS EventBridge on a schedule. The lambda function executes the app code that requests data from the NHL API and stores the response in S3 in JSON format. When a new file lands in S3 an event notifcation is sent to an SQS Queue linked to a Snowflake Snowpipe. Once the Snowpipe is notified of the new file, it reaches into S3 using a storage integration and copies the file into the Snowflake warehouse for analytics.You can find the code for this project <a href="https://github.com/alecryan88/nhl-analytics" target = "_blank">here</a>.

        <figcaption>
          Review data is collected via the One Bite REST API and staged in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data is then copied from the S3 bucket into Snowflake where it is transformed using dbt. The dbt models that are tagged with "sheets" in the dbt project are copied to a Google Sheet using a custom operator where Tableau Public dashboard can connect and display the data for free. The pipeline is orchestrated by Apache Airflow running locally in Docker. You can find the code for this project <a href="https://github.com/alecryan88/one_bite" target = "_blank">here</a>.
